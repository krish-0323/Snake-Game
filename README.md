## Snake Game

### Overview
Welcome to the **Snake Game** repository! This project is a classic Snake game implemented in **C** for the **DE1-SoC board**. The game features three levels of increasing difficulty, where players control a snake to eat fruits while avoiding collisions with walls or the snake's own body. The ultimate goal is to achieve the highest possible score while navigating through progressively challenging levels.
